## Intro

Hospital. It is a Medium Category Machine. It involves some File Upload Attack, Ghostscript Command Injection and some Windows Privesc

## Initial Recon

Following our nmap scans, first off we check out the websites on ports `8080` and `443`.

## Web Enumeration

Loading out the websites on the respective ports, on port `443` we are met with a login site same case applies to port `8080`

![port 443](https://imgur.com/mG8iUuG.png)

![port 8080](https://imgur.com/tG024km.png)

### Fuzzing

The next step is fuzzing the websites for directories. Checking out port 8080 we identify a few directories open.

vendor                  [Status: 301, Size: 320, Words: 20, Lines: 10, Duration: 200ms]
```

First thing was to test out if we could register an account because from our fuzz output we identify that the uploads directory redirects to somewhere.
![](https://imgur.com/sZNmuyx.png)

After logging in we are redirected to a page where we can upload files on the webpage.
![](https://imgur.com/ySaSfRw.png)

Look at this instantly we need to try out some file upload attacks and since we have the [resources](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-upload?source=post_page-----791ad6dd24ed--------------------------------) to do so. We see that we can that we can upload a `.phar` file instead of a php file which subsequently involves getting a shell through accessing the uploads file. 

From my research i opted to go with [powny](https://github.com/flozz/p0wny-shell) a very basic, single-file, PHP shell. After changing the extension to `phar` extension, we get a successful upload response.
From our fuzzing earlier we saw an `/uploads` which can basically access files that we've uploaded, which triggers a shell on the box.

![](https://imgur.com/Zc1hBoJ.png)


## Initial Access.
Having landed on the box, the powny shell instance was super slow for me so i decided to work from my environment and spawn back an instance on my machine using [pwncat](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat). Where we get an active session.
![](https://imgur.com/1CxIELr.png)

### Enumeration.

Running some enumeration using pwncat in built script we identify a few interesting bits of information, first of we have the systems version number.
![](https://imgur.com/ETUmbkq.png)


![](https://imgur.com/JRWLY6J.png)

A username called `drwilliams` trying to access his folder we are given permission denied as we are `www-data` and can't access content inside his folder due to insufficient permissions.

![](https://imgur.com/kipG9XY.png)


## Privesc 

Checking for vulnerabilities pertaining the system version we land on `CVE-2023–2640` a vulnerability that affects the Ubuntu kernel’s OverlayFS module.

First off we need to identify if our system is running overlay.

![](https://imgur.com/v18baZ9.png) 

and we see its running overlay to exploit this there's a public [POC](https://github.com/g1vi/CVE-2023-2640-CVE-2023-32629)

```bash
unshare -rm sh -c "mkdir l u w m && cp /u*/b*/p*3 l/;setcap cap_setuid+eip l/python3;mount -t overlay overlay -o rw,lowerdir=l,upperdir=u,workdir=w m && touch m/*; python3 -c 'import os;os.setuid(0);os.system(\"/bin/bash\")'"
```

which when executed gives us some higher privileges on the account, so basically what the bash script does is exploits the vulnerabilities CVE-2023-2640 and CVE-2023-3262 on a Ubuntu system to gain unauthorized root access. The script creates directories, copies specific Python3-related files with added capabilities, and mounts an overlay filesystem using these directories. This overlay allows the script to create a merged view of the filesystem, facilitating privilege escalation. By executing a modified Python3 script within this overlay, the user ID is set to root, and the script copies and elevates the system Bash binary, allowing execution with elevated privileges. The script concludes by cleaning up the directories and copied binaries. Notably, such activities are malicious, potentially illegal, and underscore the importance of understanding overlay filesystems, capability exploitation, and security vulnerabilities for defending against unauthorized access and maintaining system integrity.

Running the `POC` we get some root access.
![](https://imgur.com/QnESbaR.png)

Now having some privesc done,we can read the shadow file to see if we can extract and crack some exposed passwords saved on the system and luckyily we have a stored hash that we can crack and get `drwilliams`'s hash.Cracking the hash we get the password.

![](https://imgur.com/Aa2jFb3l.png)

which when trying out at port 443 of the website, we get access to the mail portal and checking the email we get an interesting email sent to `drwilliams` concerning a vulnerability on ghostscript. The exploitation can occur upon opening a PS or EPS file and can allow code execution caused by Ghostscript mishandling permission validation for pipe devices [poc](https://github.com/jakabakos/CVE-2023-36664-Ghostscript-command-injection)

![](https://imgur.com/FLksOng.png)

After reading the POC readme and following it through the exploitation occurs upon opening a PS or EPS file and can allow code execution cause by GhostScript mishandling permission validation for pipe devices, to delve deep check out [vsosciety_](https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2023-36664-command-injection-with-ghostscript)

![](https://imgur.com/zJ8a8Gg.png)

## Windows Foothold.

After sending the payload, we receive a connection back.

![](https://imgur.com/kra6hpU.png)

![](https://imgur.com/oNcq1q2.png)

Navigating to the `/Desktop` directory we get the user flag.

![](https://imgur.com/oNcq1q2.png)

Further checking the `bat` file on the Documents directory we identify that there is an embedded password on the bat file.

![](https://imgur.com/dKv1o8q.png)

## Enumerating RPCCLIENT
Having the credentials and the information from our scans, `RPC` is open, trying out the creds we got on the bat file, we get access.

## ROOT Foothold
![](https://imgur.com/3G18Iz7.png)

Going back to the windows shell instance and enumerating further on the root directory there's a `xampp` directory which has `htdocs` where all the programs for the web pages will be stored.

![](https://imgur.com/30Z8nOy.png)

Notably, we can see there's a `shell.php` laying around. I replace the Content with that PHP Powny Shell.
You will get a Shell as Administrator and finally the Root Flag.

![](https://imgur.com/TXTDJdT.png)

Checking out pownyshell we get `system` access. 

![](https://imgur.com/u0zg5rf.png)
